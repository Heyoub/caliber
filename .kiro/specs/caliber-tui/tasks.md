# Implementation Plan: CALIBER TUI

## Overview

This plan implements the CALIBER TUI terminal interface using Ratatui with the SynthBrute aesthetic.

**✅ Prerequisites Complete:**
- `caliber-pg` is production-ready with zero warnings and direct heap operations
- `caliber-api` is complete with REST/gRPC/WebSocket endpoints (14 route modules, 9 property tests)
- All core crates tested and production-hardened (165 tests passing)

**Current State:**
- **caliber-api**: ✅ COMPLETE - Full REST/gRPC/WebSocket API with auth, telemetry, and real-time events
- **caliber-tui**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS - Basic structure exists, needs full implementation

**Key Principles (from steering):**
- NO STUBS, NO TODOs - Complete code only
- CaliberResult<T> for all fallible operations
- Reference `docs/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` for type definitions
- SynthBrute visual aesthetic throughout

## Build Philosophy

**AI-NATIVE WORKFLOW:**
1. Write ALL code complete with correct types from docs/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md
2. Write ALL tests (unit + property-based)
3. Verify type alignment across all modules
4. **STOP - Human runs `cargo build --workspace` in WSL**
5. Human reports ALL errors holistically
6. Fix all errors in one iteration
7. **Human runs `cargo test --workspace` in WSL**
8. Human reports test results
9. Iterate until clean

**NO INCREMENTAL CARGO RUNS.** Windows has no pgrx/Postgres 18 support - all builds happen in WSL with human in the loop.
