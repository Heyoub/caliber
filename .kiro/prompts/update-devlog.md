# Update DEVLOG

Add an entry to the development log.

## Instructions

When updating DEVLOG.md, include:

1. **Date and title** — What was accomplished today
2. **Completed items** — Checkboxes for finished work
3. **Decisions made** — Add to the Decisions table with rationale
4. **Challenges encountered** — Document blockers and solutions
5. **Next steps** — What's coming next
6. **Kiro usage** — Update the usage statistics table

## Entry Template

```markdown
### [Date] — [Title]

**Completed:**
- [x] Item one
- [x] Item two

**Decisions:**
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [Date] | [What] | [Why] |

## Keep It Real

The DEVLOG is for judges to understand your process. Be honest about:
- What worked and what didn't
- How Kiro helped (or didn't)
- Time spent on different tasks
