## FAQ

**Why no free tier?**

CALIBER is open source. If you want free, self-host. The hosted service is for people who value their time over server management.

**Why AGPL-3.0?**

Protects against cloud providers reselling the service without contributing back. You can use CALIBER in proprietary projects — you just can't offer it as a hosted service without open-sourcing your modifications.

**Can I self-host for my company?**

Yes. AGPL allows internal use. You only need to share source if you offer CALIBER as a service to third parties.
